A tool for Windows Service developers. The program puts an icon into the Notification area/System tray and allows you to start, stop and debug services.

The tool is designed to make it easier to manage the service that you are developing. It is an alternative to using Services.msc or Task Manager which usually contains hundreds of services. The tool allows you select the ones you're interested in and control them.

It is also designed to make debugging easier; picking the correct service can be difficult when they're all named the same (for example, svchost.exe is listed _thirteen_ times in my system). You can simply click the button to attach a specific instance of Visual Studio to your running service.
